# Project Proposal for iOS PT3 Build Sprint

1. Fork and Clone this repository
2. Fill out the information below
3. Tag your TL and Instructor on your Pull Request

## Requirements

1. Do you want to work Solo or on a Team: 
        It doesn't matter to me.  I don't mind solo but if someone needs a teammate, that works too.
2. [App Idea](https://github.com/LambdaSchool/iOS-Build-Week-1): 
        I would like to work on the mortgage calculator
3. App Description (3-5 sentences):
        I want the primary function of the app to show what happens to the dependent variable of interest paid, when we adjust the independent variables of down payment, additional principle paid monthly, and interest rate.  The user could compare the amount of money they would save in interest if they paid a bit more up front or paid a bit more to the principle with their monthly payments.
4. Target Audience: (Who would want to use the app?)
        The target audience is people who are considering taking out a loan for a large purchase.

## Brainstorming

Add photos, notes, and sketches from your brain storming session. 

1. Brainstorming (Photo / Sketch)
    1. 15 min: Mind Map 
    2. 15 min: Organize ideas
    3. 10 min: Sketch mock ups 
2. If you have tons of ideas, set a timer again and keep going.
3. Don't filter yourself in the brainstorming phase, you want to capture everything and anything

## Project Plan
1. List out your tasks
2. Organize your tasks by priority
    1. Add subtasks
    2. Be specific. Every goal should be concrete, otherwise it's not actionable. 
    3. Break down large tasks into smaller tasks that you can "cross off".
3. You won't be able to do everything, focus on ~3 features / 3-5 screens that you can finish
4. Re-evaluate your progress each day and plan what you'll work on the next day
